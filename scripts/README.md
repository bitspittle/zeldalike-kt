This is a collection of scripts that have nothing directly to do with the tutorial itself;
rather, they help me keep the state of this git repo correct, e.g. verifying tags, version
numbers, etc.

Anyone who is visiting this repo to follow along in writing a simple game, you can safely
ignore the scripts in here.

This module contains interfaces that represent an entire 2D game engine. It
will be up to each game to hook up an appropriate backend depending on the
platform the game is being targeted for. These can be found in the
`game2d.engine` package.

This module also houses generally useful classes which, while used by the
game engine itself, may also be useful to users in their own projects as
well. These can be found in the `game2d.core` package.

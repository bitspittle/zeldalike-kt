This module provides helpful support classes for implementing a backend for
the game2d engine API.

It is not meant to be exposed to the end user at all - instead, modules that
implement game2d.engine.api can expect to find useful support classes here.
Essentially, this is the home for common code that would otherwise have to live
across multiple implementations.
